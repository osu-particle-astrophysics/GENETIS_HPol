This directory contains the documentation.

To view the documentation, please use the link under **About**.

To edit the `rst` files locally with Sphinx, note that 

1.  ``furo`` and ``sphinxnotes.strike`` are used so you'd need to 
    ``pip install furo`` and ``pip install sphinxnotes-strike``
2.  ``dropdown`` menu is used, so please ``pip install sphinx-panels``.
3.  ``autodoc`` is used for automatic python documentation and ``todo`` is used
    for to-do lists (no need to install these two)
