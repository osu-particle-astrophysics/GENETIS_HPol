GENETIS Documentation Repo
==========================
This documentation repo will eventually be moved to `osu-particle-physics's
Github account <https://github.com/osu-particle-astrophysics>`_.

To view the documentation, please use this `link
<https://genetis-doc.vercel.app/>`_.

To edit the `rst` files locally with Sphinx, note that ``furo`` and
``sphinxnotes.strike`` are used (see ``docs/source/conf.py``), so you'd need to
``pip install furo`` and ``pip install sphinxnotes-strike``.
As well, ``dropdown`` menu is used, so please ``pip install sphinx-panels``.
