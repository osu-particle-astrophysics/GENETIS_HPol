Tutorials & Resources [#f2]_
-----------------------------
Familiarity with the following will help you understand the content of this 
documentation.

1.  We will show you :ref:`how to use the widely used text editor Vim <a23vim>`
    to edit text files if you do not already know how to use it.
2.  Eiben and Smith. *Introduction to Evolutionary Computation*, Chapter 3.
3.  `Introduction to Bash
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nGdPrwfYJOrO6NBT76Wsh6T0hDmGHo2-23oJ1Wy
    eNcs/edit?usp=sharing>`_
4.  `Introduction to Python
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DE17HB2dLsMPQzet1ZIqUxwcIsxsSCuobRSyJ2
    EvvtA/edit?usp=sharing>`_
5.  `Introduction to Git
    <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/
    1XAEuB0XGQ_jhbgiqm9zihPSxFi_rOw7Lv4Y_4BgT0Uc/edit?usp=sharing>`_
6.  `Introduction to OSC
    <https://www.osc.edu/resources/getting_started/new_user_resource_guide>`_


We mainly control XFdtd through its own language *xmacro*, the syntax
of which is somewhat similar to Java, but we will also discuss 
:ref:`how to work with the GUI of XFdtd <a312>`.
Information apropos xmacro can be found via the ``help`` function inside the GUI
of XFdtd; unforunately, there is not a tutorial on this language.

    Practice Getting to Know the Loop needs updates

After reading this User's Guide, one is encouraged to complete the 
assignment `Practice Getting to Know the Loop
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vdWo8iH8l1X26aerbZ0dbrPm_dtDZ-1fqj4H4hbL5Q0

Our Links [#f3]_
----------------

..  todo::

    *   Slack link
    *   Dropbox link

If you are a new member of the OSU GENETIS team, note that we have a `Slack 
workspace <https://join.slack.com/t/gpantennas/shared_invite/
zt-21mj4cdpf-3ircnWgKZkut0ZDP1ZvoJg>`_, an `ELOG
<http://radiorm.physics.ohio-state.edu/elog/GENETIS/>`_, a
Dropbox, and a `Google drive
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iDamk46R2_oOLHtvsOg4jNy05mCiB7Sn>`_, 
and we can grant access upon request.
Lastly, here is an *outdated* `GitHub repo for dipole evolution
<https://github.com/hchasan/XF-Scripts>`_

.. To use the PAEA loop, you need the following:

.. 1.  XFdtd: note you need this to be purchased through Remcom if you are not an
..     OSU Connolly group researcher. If you are working with the GENETIS team,
..     this is already installed on the supercomputers we use.
.. 2.  `PAEA Github
..     <https://github.com/osu-particle-astrophysics/GENETISBicone>`_
.. 3.  `AraSim package <https://github.com/ara-software/AraSim>`_

.. To use the AREA loop, you need the following software installed:

.. 1.  `Area Github <https://github.com/gp-antennas/AREA>`_
.. 2.  `AraSim package <https://github.com/ara-software/AraSim>`_

.. If you are a part of the GENETIS project, you do not need to add a copy of any
.. of this software to your user from GitHub. 
.. Instead, we run a communal copy of PAEA on the project space PAS1960; 
.. this allows us to not have to change the directories in the main bash script
.. each time we pull a version that was recently pushed to GitHub.
.. Additionally, we have a limited number of XF licenses,
.. and a maximum number of jobs that can be submitted at one time within the
.. Connolly project folder.
.. This makes it impossible for multiple users to be
.. running the loop at the same time, even if the software were installed on their
.. individual user's home directors versus the general Connolly project space;
.. thus, as a part of the GENETIS team you will not need to install this,
.. and you will run on a communal copy in a general project space on OSC 
.. (project space PAS1960). Proceed forward for information on how to do so.

.. ..  todo::

..     check if AREA info is still correct

.. If you have correctly set up your ``.bashrc`` as instructed in :ref:`a23`
.. you can access the PAEA directory by typing ``GE60`` to access the bicone
.. folder on ``PAS1960``.
.. For Connolly group users, the AREA software is set up on another researcher's
.. account. 
.. Please reach out to the group on how to proceed until it is transferred over to
.. ``PAS1960``.

.. Set the ``GE60`` alias with the following, as seen in :ref:`a23`

.. ..  code-block:: Bash

..     alias GE60='cd /fs/ess/PAS1960/BiconeEvolutionOSC/BiconeEvolution/\
..     current_antenna_evo_build/XF_Loop/Evolutionary_Loop/'

.. If you are not part of the Connolly group,
.. you will need to set up your bash script with the appropriate alias,
.. and the rest of this section may not apply perfectly for you;
.. however, it should still give you some general guidance.
