# Discussion: PAEA [^f1]
In this section we introduce the Physical Antenna Evolution Algorithm (PAEA).

These GAs all involve the integration of XFdtd and AraSim to obtain the fitness
scores, as shown in {numref}`fig_GA_diagram`.

The results presented in this section involve the evolution of a bicone-based
antenna. A bicone antenna consists of two cones with the openings facing
opposite directions, as illustrated in {numref}`fig_asymmetric_Bicone`. This
shape was selected for an initial evolution because it is the same geometry as
antennas currently deployed in the ARA experiment. 

In addition to the initial symmetric bicone evolution, there have been multiple
other versions of the physical antenna evolution, each with increasing
complexity. The following are the iterations that will be discussed in this
section: (1) The symmetric bicone antenna, (2) the asymmetric bicone evolution,
and (3) the asymmetric bicone with nonlinear sides.
