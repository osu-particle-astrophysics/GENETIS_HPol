# Early GENETIS Investigations [^f1]

Before getting into the optimization of the antennas, GENETIS produced
proof-of-concept studies to understand GAs better and build a foundation of
knowledge. In this section, we will briefly discuss some of the details of our
earlier studies.


## Quarter-Wavelength Dipole Antenna
As our first proof-of-concept, the GENETIS team used a GA to recreate the
length solution for a quarter-wavelength dipole at 3 GHz. Since this is a
problem with a known solution, this helped us explore both the effectiveness of
a GA at finding the solution and the number of generations it takes on average
to arrive at the correct answer.

The quarter-wavelength dipole study was the first version of our loop software.
It was similar to the current version; however, the fitness evaluation was more
straightforward. This GA began the loop by randomly generating genes for the
initial population (radius and length). Genes for the initial population were
initialized via a uniform distribution, converted to a normal distribution
using the Box Muller method. The Box Muller method can be used to convert
pairs of numbers that are uniformly distributed to numbers that are normally
distributed {cite}`boxmuller`. 
The fitness function involved using XFdtd, an antenna simulation software, to
produce gain patterns for each solution.
The fitness score was simply the measure of peak gain relative to that expected
for a quarter-wavelength dipole at 3 GHz. 
Solutions with a smaller difference in gain pattern to the expected result were
scored as performing better.
The GA modified the generations using mutation, where each individual's genes
were mutated and passed on to the next generation; 
thus, all individuals went through the mutation operator to construct the next
generation, and no selection methods were used.
Each individual's genes were mutated through a Gaussian distribution centered
on the current value, with a standard deviation proportional to the fitness
score.
The GA converged by adjusting the magnitude of the mutations based on the
fitness score.
If an individual was closer to the solution than prior generations, it mutated
with a standard deviation 0.9 times the last deviation.
If the individual were further from the solution, it would mutate using a
standard deviation of the prior deviation divided by 0.9%

Results for the evolution of a quarter-wavelength dipole antenna solution
showing the improvement of the average length toward the known solution.
```

As seen in {numref}`QuartWaveresults_fig`, the results of this study show that
with a population of 5 individuals and 13 generations, the design converged to
the expected result very quickly.
The best individuals matched the expected results. The average per generation
doesn't quite reach the solution because the mutation operator is constantly
adjusting each individual.
This result provided an initial proof of concept for the use of a GA for
antenna design and laid an initial foundation for future GENETIS endeavours.
