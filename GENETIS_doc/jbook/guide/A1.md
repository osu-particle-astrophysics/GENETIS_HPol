## Tutorials & Resources [^f2]

Familiarity with the following will help you understand the content of this
documentation.

1. We will show you {ref}`how to use the widely used text editor Vim <a23vim>`
   to edit text files if you do not already know how to use it.
2. Eiben and Smith. *Introduction to Evolutionary Computation*, Chapter 3.
3. [Introduction to Bash](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nGdPrwfYJOrO6NBT76Wsh6T0hDmGHo2-23oJ1WyeNcs/edit?usp=sharing)
4. [Introduction to Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DE17HB2dLsMPQzet1ZIqUxwcIsxsSCuobRSyJ2EvvtA/edit?usp=sharing)
5. [Introduction to Git](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XAEuB0XGQ_jhbgiqm9zihPSxFi_rOw7Lv4Y_4BgT0Uc/edit?usp=sharing)
6. [Introduction to OSC](https://www.osc.edu/resources/getting_started/new_user_resource_guide)

We mainly control XFdtd through its own language *xmacro*, the syntax
of which is somewhat similar to Java, but we will also discuss
{ref}`how to work with the GUI of XFdtd <a2xfdtd>`.
Information apropos xmacro can be found via the `help` function inside the GUI
of XFdtd; unforunately, there is not a tutorial on this language.
