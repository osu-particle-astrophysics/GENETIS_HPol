# Part (F): Plotting

<!-- Part (F) is primarily responsible for running all of our plotting software. It -->
<!-- is called `Part_F_asym.sh` for the linear case. For the nonlinear case, it is -->
<!-- called `Loop_Parts/Part_F/Part_F_Curved.sh`. More specifically, this part -->
<!-- plots the fitness scores of all individuals, in 3D and 2D, of current and -->
<!-- previous generations' scores. It then sends them to an email address that is set -->
<!-- to automatically upload plots to our Dropbox. This allows easy access to plots -->
<!-- as each generation finishes without the need for OSC access. -->
