# Part (A): genetic algorithm [^f1]

```{admonition} TODO

    introduce ``paretns.csv``

`Evolutionary_loop/Part_A.sh` does two things:

1. It calls the {doc}`genetic algorithm <../../ga_ref/ga_doc_temp>`
   (GA), a program that outputs "DNA", ie. antenna parameters. These are stored
   in `generationDNA.csv`.
2. It moves the GA outputs under the `Evolutionrary_loop/Run_Outputs/`
   directory so that they are not overwritten.

Note that the GA is inside a 
[Git submodule](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-submodule).
In other words, `Shared-Code` is a 
[seperate GENETIS repository](https://github.com/osu-particle-astrophysics/Shared-Code).

:::{note}
As of August 15, 2023, `GENETIS_HPol` uses the `hpol` branch of
`Shared-Code`.
