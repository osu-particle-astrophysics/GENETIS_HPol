# Part (D1) and (D2): AraSim execution
<!--  -->
<!-- Sub-Bash scripts for parts (D1) and (D2) are responsible for executing AraSim. -->
<!-- AraSim is a neutrino simulation software that simulates the environment the ARA -->
<!-- antennas experience in Antarctica when taking data. AraSim generates neutrino -->
<!-- events independent of each other, with interaction point locations chosen with a -->
<!-- uniform density in the ice. For computational ease, neutrinos are generated -->
<!-- within a 3-5 km radius around the center of a single station for neutrino -->
<!-- energies from $E_\nu = 10^{17}$ eV-$10^{21}$ eV, with the -->
<!-- larger radii used for higher energies. AraSim then performs ray tracing and -->
<!-- attenuation on the signal and calculates what electromagnetic radiation reaches -->
<!-- the station. At the station, the gain and phase data from XF are used to -->
<!-- calculate the sensitivity of the antenna to neutrinos. This value is extracted -->
<!-- as an effective sensitive ice volume (called the 'effective volume'). This -->
<!-- effective volume is our fitness measurement, called the fitness score, for all -->
<!-- individuals. For more information on what AraSim does, please see -->
<!-- **Chapter 3.2.2.2**. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ```{eval-rst} -->
<!-- ..  todo:: -->
<!--  -->
<!--     *   reference 3.2.2.2 -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Before going into the detail of these scripts, it's important to note that to -->
<!-- run AraSim, we need to submit jobs in order to fully utilize the computational -->
<!-- power of the supercomputing cluster. To submit a job, a short script is run that -->
<!-- contains a number of parameters for the cluster. Jobs allow the user to specify -->
<!-- the number of cores to use, the number of GPUs to use, and a time limit. You are -->
<!-- also more easily able to run many jobs in parallel, which means we can run -->
<!-- multiple simulations at once instead of waiting for each individual simulation -->
<!-- to run before starting the next. Note that running a program through the command -->
<!-- line instead of submitting a job will work, but it will be significantly slower -->
<!-- and may time out before completion. Jobs allow the cluster to allocate cores and -->
<!-- time to users appropriately, so you may have to wait for a job to start, -->
<!-- especially if you are requesting significant computational power. Please see -->
<!-- more about job submissions on the [OSC site](https://www.osc.edu/supercomputing/batch-processing-at-osc/job-submission). -->
<!-- Though this may seem intimidating, our software is set up to -->
<!-- automatically submit AraSim jobs; the user bears no responsibility in submitting -->
<!-- the jobs manually. This, as well as the remainder of discussions apropos AraSim, -->
<!-- is noteworthy information that can assist in properly understanding our software -->
<!-- for future modifications; however, it is not essential to starting a run if no -->
<!-- modifications are needed. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- One more note-worthy mention is that because these jobs take a long time, we -->
<!-- have modified our run so that, for each individual, we break up the number of -->
<!-- neutrinos into smaller jobs and utilize the ability to run simulations in -->
<!-- parallel. For example, if our variable NNT=30,000, making Seeds=10 means that we -->
<!-- divide a total of 300k neutrinos into 10 jobs that will run in parallel; this -->
<!-- dramatically speeds up our run time. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ```{eval-rst} -->
<!-- ..  todo:: -->
<!--  -->
<!--     change this into ``part_d_job1.py`` and ``part_d_job2.py`` API -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!--  -->
<!-- In the rest of this section, we will discuss the two sub-Bash scripts that are -->
<!-- responsible for running the simulation of our antennas in Antarctica using -->
<!-- AraSim. Part (D1) is responsible for running two things: (1) it moves each .dat -->
<!-- file into a folder AraSim can access, while changing it to a .txt, which is what -->
<!-- AraSim reads, and (2) it runs AraSim for each individual and moves the output -->
<!-- into the `Antenna_Performance_Metric` folder. It also makes a directory for -->
<!-- all errors and output files from AraSim to be dumped. Part (D2) is responsible -->
<!-- for telling our loop to wait until AraSim is finished running. This will check -->
<!-- the completed files and make sure they all appear before moving on to the next -->
<!-- part.  This checks that both (1) the jobs finished and (2) that they were -->
<!-- successful. If it is unsuccessful, it will resubmit the job. It does so by -->
<!-- using the `grep` command to search the files for segmentation violations. If -->
<!-- it sees one, it resubmits that job. Note that we also submit a job for the -->
<!-- actual ARA bicone during the first generation so it can be compared against in -->
<!-- our run. -->
