# GENETIS Home


## Welcome
Welcome to the GENETIS project!

This documentation is based on the dissertation by 
[Dr. Julie Rolla](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/ws/send_file/send?accession=osu163668789451345&disposition=inline).
It follows the [Di√°taxis documentation guideline](https://diataxis.fr/):

```{admonition} Navigation
:class: seealso, dropdown
*  The **Dissertation Excerpt** is intended to be a 
    [discussion](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/).

    This part of the documentation is based on Chapter 2 and 3 of Julie's
    disseration.

*  If you are joining our team, you can find onboarding documents under the
    **New GENETIS Members** section.
    *  {doc}`guide/A1` is intended to be a set of 
        [tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/).

    *  {doc}`guide/A2` is a set of 
        [how-to guides](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/).

* **HPol Manual** is based on the Appendix of the dissertation,
    it is mainly intended to be an automatically generated 
    [reference guide](https://diataxis.fr/reference/), so 
    it is recommended that you read through the other parts of the
    documentation first.
