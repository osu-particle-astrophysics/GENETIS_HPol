This is a `reference guide <https://diataxis.fr/reference/>`_ for the genetic
algorithm (GA) located inside ``Shared-Code/GA/``.


Our genetic algorithm evolves antennas (also known as the "individuals") over a
set number of generations. To do so, the algorithm generates genes for
first-generation individuals, and for the subsequent generations, the
algorithm selects parents to produce offsprings. [^f1]

See **Chapter 2** for more details on what GAs do. 
See **Chapter 3.4.2** for details on what the linear, asymmetric
bicone GA contains in terms of selection methods, operators, and constraints,
and see **Chapter 3.4.3** for details on what the nonlinear, asymmetric
bicone GA contains in terms of selection methods, operators and constraints.
