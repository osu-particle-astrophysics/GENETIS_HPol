# Part (C): XFdtd output conversion code

```{eval-rst}
..  todo::

    change this page to ``part_c.py`` API
```

Part (C), which calls `Part\_C.sh` is responsible for converting our XFdtd
output format. In order to run AraSim we need to make the files that XFdtd
outputs readable by AraSim. This means converting the .uan files from XF into
.dat files that AraSim can read. This is done in the XFintoARA.py file. Once
this is done we move them into the AraSim directory.
