The OSU GENETIS team has several projects.
These include the Physical Antenna Evolution Algorithm (PAEA),
Antenna Response Evolution Algorithm (AREA),
and **NEBULOUS**. Here we will focus on PAEA, which has three subprojects:

1. `GENETIS_PUEO`:

   Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observation (PUEO) dual-polarization
   quad-ridged horn antenna evolution

2. `GENETIS_ARA`:

   Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) vertically polarized (VPol) bicone antenna
   evolution. The terms "VPol" and "bicone" are used synonymously.

3. `GENETIS_HPol`:

   Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) horizontally polarized (HPol) quad-slot
   cylindrical antenna evolution

:::{note}
The long-term plan is to combine all of these into one project with a
{term}`Design` switch to allow users to switch between the three.

## The "Loop"

Before we begin, note that every GENETIS project has a
{doc}`main script <A3_1>` that is essentially a `while` loop.
Consequently, a GENETIS project is simply referred to by the team as *the loop*.


:::{glossary}
Loop /'lÃ¼p/
    A colloquial term that refers to any GENETIS projects.
    > "Ah! The `HPol` loop is broken again. I wonder who wrote this piece of
      garbage"

We next introduce the PAEA project using `GENETIS_HPol` as an example.
