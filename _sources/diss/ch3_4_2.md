A schematic of an asymmetric bicone antenna. The lengths ($L_1$, $L_2$), inner
radii ($r_1$, $r_2$), opening angles ($\theta_1$, $\theta_2$), and separation
distance ($s$) fully define the geometry. In the results presented here, the
separation distance was held constant, and the other six parameters were
varied.
